You also gain the incorporeal trait, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the Pass Through feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit.

This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally-you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal negative damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks-typically Athletics checks-against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete.

While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d6}[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage} and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals [[/r {1d4}[bludgeoning]]]{1d4 bludgeoning damage} and has the agile and finesse traits. Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the sterling dynamo archetype.</p>"},"featType":{"value":"archetype"},"level":{"value":2},"location":"","prerequisites":{"value":[]},"rules":[{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.AutomaticPercussive","value":"feature:dynamo:automatic-percussive"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.AutomaticPower","value":"feature:dynamo:automatic-power"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.ManualPercussive","value":"feature:dynamo:manual-percussive"},{"label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.ManualPower","value":"feature:dynamo:manual-power"}],"flag":"dynamoChoice","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.UI.RuleElements.ChoiceSet.Prompt"},{"domain":"all","key":"RollOption","option":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.dynamoChoice}"},{"category":"unarmed","damage":{"base":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","dice":1,"die":"d8"}},"group":"brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unarmed-attacks/fist-earth-elemental.webp","key":"Strike","label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.Label","predicate":{"all":["feature:dynamo:manual-power"]},"range":null,"traits":["unarmed","shove"]},{"category":"unarmed","damage":{"base":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","dice":1,"die":"d6"}},"group":"brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unarmed-attacks/fist-earth-elemental.webp","key":"Strike","label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.Label","predicate":{"all":["feature:dynamo:automatic-power"]},"range":null,"traits":["unarmed","shove"]},{"category":"unarmed","damage":{"base":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","dice":1,"die":"d6"}},"group":"brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unarmed-attacks/fist-earth-elemental.webp","key":"Strike","label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.Label","predicate":{"all":["feature:dynamo:manual-percussive"]},"range":null,"traits":["unarmed","agile","finesse"]},{"category":"unarmed","damage":{"base":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","dice":1,"die":"d4"}},"group":"brawling","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/unarmed-attacks/fist-earth-elemental.webp","key":"Strike","label":"PF2E.SpecificRule.SterlingDynamo.Label","predicate":{"all":["feature:dynamo:automatic-percussive"]},"range":null,"traits":["unarmed","agile","finesse"]}],"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"custom":"","rarity":"uncommon","value":["archetype","dedication"]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feats.webp","name":"Sterling Dynamo Dedication","type":"feat"},"sticky-bomb":{"_id":"zXKfKKOxht0b0XNL","data":{"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actionType":{"value":"free"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.Quick Alchemy]{Quick Alchemy} to craft an alchemical bomb, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You mix in an additive to make your bomb's contents adhere to the target and continue to deal damage.</p>\n<p>A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage.
